usage: catw {OPTIONS} [FILES...] -o OUTFILE

  If FILES is "-", read from stdin.
  If there is no OUTFILE, write to stdout and exit without watching.

  OPTIONS:

    -w, --watch    Watch for changes. Default: true except when writing to "-".
    -v, --verbose  Print the number of bytes written whenever a file changes.
    -h, --help     Print this help message.

Make sure to escape the globs that you want `catw` to watch so your shell won't
expand them.
